How to use this little console chat application:

<!All commands are in brackets("")! You aren't supposed to put the brackets into cmd or terminal!>
<!Server and every client need to use same port!>

Prerequisites:
1)You need to have Java installed on your device.(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

Usage:
Server side:
1)Launch the server.
    Open cmd or terminal and type "java Server [port number]".
    If you haven't put the port number("java Server"), it will run on port 1500 by default.

Client side(server side can also do this step if you want to be a client and a server simultaneously):
1)Launch the client.
    Open cmd or terminal and type "java Client [username] [port number] [server address]".
    Default values(if you used only "java Client") are: java Client Anonymous 1500 localhost.

Additional client options:
    LOGOUT - end session
    WHOISIN - shows all online users
